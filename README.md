# Introduction
Semantic analysis, also known as sentiment analysis or opinion mining, is the process of determining the underlying sentiment or emotion expressed in a given piece of text. This project aims to analyze the emotions present in a text file using Python and visualize them in a graph.

The notebook utilizes a predefined set of emotions from the provided emotion.txt file. It matches the words in the input text from read.txt against these emotions and calculates the frequency of each emotion. The final result is a graph that illustrates the distribution of emotions in the text.

# Dependencies
To run the notebook, you need the following dependencies:

Python (version 3.x)
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
Matplotlib
Pandas
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

# Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine or download the notebook file (semantic_analysis.ipynb) directly.
Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Open the notebook file (semantic_analysis.ipynb) in the Jupyter interface.
Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the code cells.

# Input Files
The notebook requires two input files:

1- read.txt: This file should contain the input text you want to analyze for emotions. Make sure the text is properly formatted and readable.
2- emotion.txt: This file contains a list of emotions, with each emotion listed on a separate line. The emotions serve as the basis for matching against the words in the input text.

# Output
The notebook generates a graph that represents the distribution of emotions found in the input text. The graph provides an overview of the prevalence of various emotions within the text.

You can save the graph generated by the notebook for further use or sharing.
